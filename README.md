# Weather-Data-Analysis-and-Preprocessing-using-OpenWeather-API

## Task Description
This script was created primarily for data analytics, with an emphasis on retrieving weather data using the OpenWeather API. This file provides a simple tutorial for obtaining an API key from OpenWeatherMap and using it to extract weather data. This script's main output is the weather dataset, which can be saved at a desired file location. Furthermore, for documentation, the script contains Jupyter Notebook cells with markdowns, and outputs, such as graphs, are embedded within the notebook.

## API Key
To use the file, one will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Follow the steps below to generate the API key:
1. Visit openweathermap.org.
2. Get signed up and make an account.
3. Verify your email address.
4. Sign in to your account.
5. Find the section that says "API keys."
6. Create an API key and give it a name. This key would further be used to request the dataset.
7. Keep a copy of your API key safe.
8. Review the API instructions to learn how to use it.

## Usage
This script is distributed as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file with integrated markdown cells for documentation. Launch the Jupyter Notebook in your choice environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab) and follow the instructions provided. One can run the cells to execute the code and receive weather data from OpenWeatherMap using your API key.

## Features
- **In-depth analysis**: The file consists of a detailed data analysis procedure. Techniques like exploratory data analysis and feature engineering are some to name a few.
- **Plots and Visualisations**: The notebook generates several plots and visualisations to assist better understanding the weather data.
- **Interesting Questions**: Using data science approaches, the analysis answers interesting questions about the dataset, delivering important insights.

## Output
The weather dataset is the major output of this script, and it may be saved to a given file directory. Cells in the Jupyter Notebook provide extra outputs such as charts and visualisations which further aid analysis, all within the notebook.
